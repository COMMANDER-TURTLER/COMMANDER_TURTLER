Command structure
Strategic firearms commander (SFC)
Determines the strategic objectives and sets any tactical parameters. Retains strategic oversight and overall command and responsibility.
Tactical firearms commander (TFC)
Develops, commands and coordinates the overall tactical response in accordance with strategic objectives.
Operational firearms commander(s) (OFC)
Commands a group of officers carrying out functional or territorial responsibilities related to a tactical plan. 
Command roles and functions
The command structure offers flexibility in response to a varied and developing range of circumstances and is functional rather than based on rank. The structure must be clearly articulated to all those involved in the operation and documented if practicable in the circumstances.

The function of the SFC or TFC must not be undertaken by the senior investigating officer (SIO) responsible for the investigation of the offence(s) for which the firearms operation is being conducted, or by any other person who is involved in the investigation. There must be complete separation and clarity in respect of the responsibilities of each function, particularly when either is being performed by an officer who is currently accredited for more than one of those functions.

In protracted investigations where an individual has previously performed a core investigative role in that investigation or operation but is no longer doing so, they may perform the role of SFC or TFC. Where this is the case the transfer of those investigative and command responsibilities must be recorded in order to demonstrate a clear separation of those roles. However, command and investigative roles during an operation must not be considered routinely interchangeable.

The separation of SFC and SIO roles may however not be necessary during kidnap operations, prior to the safe recovery of the hostage(s) and where the operational priority is the preservation of life.

It is the responsibility of the SFC to satisfy themselves that the tactical plan is capable of meeting the strategic aims of the operation, and that the provisions of ECHR Article 2 take precedence.

Any change of command structure should, where time permits, be approved by the SFC and must then be documented.
